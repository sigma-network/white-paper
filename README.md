# Sigma Network white paper

***Update***: Renamed to [Mir](https://github.com/mir-core/). This repo is now obsolete.

This repository contains the Sigma Network white paper, which gives an overview of the protocol. See the [PDF](sigma-network.pdf).

The paper is a work in progress. Some sections are finished, but others need a lot more work.
